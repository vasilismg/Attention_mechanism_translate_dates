# Attention mechanism - translate dates


The following project is based on the programming assignments of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow.

The goal of the project is to translate dates from human readable format ("3 May 1979", "5 April 09") to machine readable format ("1979-05-03", "2009-04-05"), using the attention mechanism.

I was able to achieve accuracy of 80% on the testing set.
