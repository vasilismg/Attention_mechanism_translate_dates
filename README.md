# Attention mechanism - translate dates

[Attention mechanism - translate dates](https://github.com/vasilismg/Attention_mechanism_translate_dates/blob/master/Attention_mechanism_translate_dates.ipynb): Translate dates from human readable format ("3 May 1979", "5 April 09") to machine readable format ("1979-05-03", "2009-04-05"), using the attention mechanism. I was able to achieve accuracy of 80% on the testing set.

The project is based on the programming assignments of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow.
