# Attention mechanism - translate dates


The following project is based on the programming assignments of deeplearning.ai, course Sequence models. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow.

The goal of the project is to translate dates from human readable to machine readable format using the attention mechanism.
